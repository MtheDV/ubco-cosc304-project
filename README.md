# ubco-cosc304-project <br> *Not Elon-chan's Electric Car Company (NECECC)*
A project created as part of the cosc 304 class. Required to build an ecommerce website within a 4 person team following specific guidelines.

Our goal is to give customers the opportunity to easily filter, identify and purchase the EV that fits their every need. Everyone knows you can google Elon and then buy his car, which is multiple versions of the same thing. OEM manufactures are catching on to the EV hype and NECECC is here to help you decide which car you need.


**Executive Summary:** <br>
	With the exponential growth of EV OEM options and new manufacturers, choosing which one is right for you can be daunting. Whether you are trying to find an EV to serve your fleet of commercial vehicles, or picking your replacement for a gas guzzling car, our database is designed to aid in your search by grouping and filtering EVs that are available on the market. The goal of our database is to make the transition into the world of EV easier. We aim to bring forward all choices for EV in an accessible way and allow the customer to choose the best suited vehicle to their requirements. 
When visiting a dealership, there are many hurdles you may face trying to find out all the unbiased information about the vehicle and its competitors. Because we are independent, the information we provide is confirmed by the manufacturer and impartial.
When visiting our online store Buy EV, you can create an account to save your favourite choices and come back later to buy them. There are many features on the store to help you identify which EV fits your lifestyle. 


1. Welcome to the homepage of NECECC. Returning customers can easily jump back to their last visit by using the “Login” tab in the navigation bar or the “Customer Info” button. New customers have the option to dive into the database using “Begin Shopping” button or the “Products” tab. Using the “Login” tab or “Customer Info” button, customers are able to create new accounts. Administrators have a separate button for their Login credentials. Or just stay on this page and enjoy video of an EV available on our site driving off into the sunset.

2. To gain access to the customer’s purchase records, previous shopping cart and to make a new purchase, you will be prompted by our “Login” portal if you are not already logged in. Here you have a chance to create a new user account or use the username and password you created during initial registration.

5. Time to start searching through our database. Use the search bar if the name or manufacturer of the vehicle is already known. The vehicles are sorted by alphanumeric order by default. There is an image of each vehicle along with the make, model and MSRP. There is also an “Add to Cart” button to offer a shortcut to quickly purchase a new vehicle. To reset the database search bar, leave it blank and press the “Submit” button again.

7. Here is an example of the information listed for each EV on our database. Most important, and at the top of the list, the Type of EV. This is where the database shows you whether the vehicle is a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) or a battery electric vehicle (BEV).

8. Next to the “Car Details” tab, there is a reviews tab where each account is allowed to leave maximum one review on a vehicle. Shown in the image to the right, is a review left by another account user. The review consists of a star rating and a written section. Each review is dated, and the user account used to make the review is shown to verify it is made by a registered user.

9. Once the vehicles and their quantity have been chosen, the customer can view their cart and review their order. The order total is displayed at the bottom of the order summary. On this page, the quantities can be adjusted and removed. At the bottom of the page, there is an option to “Continue Shopping” or to “Check Out.” At this point in the user experience, if the user has not signed in already and wants to check out, they will be asked to log in or create an account before moving forward with their purchase.
